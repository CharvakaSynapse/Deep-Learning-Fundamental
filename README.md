# Decoding the Hessian: Understanding Optimization Challenges in Deep Learning

This repository contains the article **"Decoding the Hessian: The Role of the Hessian in Optimization Challenges"**  It aims to offer a clear and practical perspective on how the Hessian matrix—through its eigenvalues and curvature—affects the behavior of gradient-based optimization in neural networks.

## About the Article

Training deep networks often feels like navigating an unpredictable loss landscape. This article explores:

- How the Hessian matrix reveals curvature and convexity.
- Why singular or low-rank Hessians slow down convergence or break second-order optimizers.
- The role of eigenvalues in adjusting learning rates and optimization stability.
- How regularization techniques (like adding εI or ridge regression) help in poorly conditioned settings.

It doesn’t promise to fix bad training runs—but it will clarify what’s going wrong under the hood.

## Key Topics Covered

- Convexity and positive definiteness
- Interpretation of Hessian eigenvalues
- Failure modes of gradient descent and Newton’s method
- Regularization to restore invertibility
- Learning rate and step-size dynamics in curved loss surfaces
- Practical relevance to training deep neural networks
