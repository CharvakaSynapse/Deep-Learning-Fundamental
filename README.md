# Decoding the Hessian: The Role of the Hessian in Optimization Challenges

This repository contains my in-depth exploration of how the Hessian matrix influences optimization in deep learning. The write-up connects curvature, eigenvalues, step sizes, and training stability in both convex and non-convex loss landscapes.
